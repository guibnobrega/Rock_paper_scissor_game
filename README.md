A simple and modular implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game built with Python. This educational project demonstrates clean code practices by separating game logic, data, and the user interface.

## 🚀 Features

- **Classic Gameplay:** Standard implementation of the rules (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock).
- **Modular Architecture:** Logic is separated from data and the main loop for better maintainability.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures the game runs smoothly even with unexpected user inputs.

## 📂 Project Structure

The code is organized into three main files:

- **`main.py`**: The entry point. Handles the command-line interface (CLI) and the main game loop.
- **`functions.py`**: Contains the core game logic, including move comparison and input validation.
- **`data.py`**: Stores game constants, ASCII art, and configuration data.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8** or newer.
